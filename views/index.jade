        p
          | Subscription services targeted at the venture capital and private equity markets are plentiful and are typically
          | excellent sources of investment data and exit information.
        p
          | Unfortunately, most services still require users to perform numerous manual steps to turn raw data into meaningful
          | insights that relate to their own context or can be compared to internal information. The challenge is compounded
          | by todayâ€™s proliferation of generic third-party sources that do not address the unique needs of Corporate Venture
          | users and lack data outside the USA.
